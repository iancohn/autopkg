<P>Symantec Endpoint Protection is an anti-malware and software firewall product for both personal and corporate systems.</P>
<P>Please also note that after the installation of this program and periodically (daily or weekly) thereafter, users must run the software's "LiveUpdate" in order to obtain the latest and most current virus definition files. Failure to update virus definition files will leave a computer vulnerable to new viruses.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>
<P>Network Threat Protection provides a firewall and intrusion prevention protection to prevent intrusion attacks and malicious content from reaching the computer that runs the Symantec Endpoint Protection client. The firewall allows or blocks network traffic based on various criteria that the administrator or end user sets.</P>
<P>The client also analyzes all the incoming and the outgoing information for the data patterns that are typical of an attack. It detects and blocks malicious traffic and attempts by outside users to attack the client computer. Intrusion prevention also monitors outbound traffic and prevents the spread of worms.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL dir=ltr>
<LI>
<DIV><STRONG>Proactive Threat Protection</STRONG></DIV></LI></UL>
<BLOCKQUOTE style="MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px" dir=ltr>
<P>Proactive Threat Protection provides protection against zero-day attack vulnerabilities in your network. Zero-day attack vulnerabilities are new vulnerabilities that are not yet publicly known. Threats that exploit these vulnerabilities can evade signature-based detection (such as antispyware and antispyware definitions). Zero-day attacks may be used in targeted attacks and in the propagation of malicious code.</P>
<P>Proactive Threat Protection includes the following:</P>
<UL type=disc>
<LI>
<P>TruScan proactive threat scans</P>
<LI>
<P>Application and Device Control Policies</P></LI></UL></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>This task installs the unmanged version of Symantec Endpoint Protection. For a managed installation, it is recommended to create an installer from your SEP Management server. You may wish to use the Fixlet Maker dashboard to use the SysMan provided template - 'Configuration: Convert to Managed Symantec Endpoint Protection Client - Windows' to create a deployment task for your installation.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>]]></string>
